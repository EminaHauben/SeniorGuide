Hello, 
This project is about making it easier for senior users to use the web. 
The intended use is that people who need to know something specific click on the respective topic (in my case I have "WhatsApp" and "Photos" to choose from), and it will redirect them to that part of the web page.
Then there are a few questions per topic provided, they click on one of them, and it will load a pdf document with the instructions for that question.

I have used Bootstrap (HTML, CSS, JS) for the front end, and OneDrive as the back end to store the pdfs. 
Note: I have used my school account for OneDrive, which did not allow me to share documents publicly. However, I have set it so that everyone within IU can see it. Please keep this in mind while testing.
